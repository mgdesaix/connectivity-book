# Introduction

This text outlines how to create migratory networks using the R package `Mignette` (**Mig**ratory **net**work **t**ools **e**nsemble). `Mignette` was developed to facilitate conservation and management decision-making for migratory wildlife populations with genetic data. Genetic data are used for the delineation of breeding populations, as well as for the assignment of individuals sampled from non-breeding populations to their likely origin of breeding. Habitat suitability metrics are used to determine the relative importance of different breeding and non-breeding populations to the overall migratory network. `Mignette` also allows users to incorporate assignment data from geolocators. The creation of a migratory network is broken into three main parts:

1. Delineating [breeding nodes](#breeding)
2. Delineating [non-breeding nodes](#wintering)
3. Create [migratory network](#connectivity)

Users with pre-existing data specifying breeding and non-breeding populations, population assignment, and habitat suitability metrics for the populations can use their data directly for the [creation of migratory network steps](#connectivity) in `Mignette`. We also provide tools within `Mignette` to facilitate the [delineation of breeding nodes](#breeding) and [non-breeding nodes](#wintering), and provide examples with migratory bird species.

## Installation 

You can install the development version of Mignette from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mgdesaix/Mignette")
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
