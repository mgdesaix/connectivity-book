# Introduction

This text outlines how to create migratory connectivity networks using the R package `MuSpTest` (*We need a name!*). The creation of the migratory connectivity networks is broken into three main parts:

1. Delineating [breeding nodes](#breeding)
2. Delineating [wintering nodes](#wintering)
3. Create [migratory connectivity network](#connectivity)

## Installation 

You can install the development version of MuSpTest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mgdesaix/MuSpTest", auth_token = "xxx")
```

**Note:** The `auth_token =` specifies my personal access token to allow the download because it is currently a private repository. Replace "xxx" with the token until we make the repository public.



```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
