Mignette was developed to facilitate conservation and management decision-making for migratory wildlife populations with genetic data. Genetic data are used for the delineation of breeding populations, as well as for the assignment of individuals sampled from non-breeding populations to their likely origin of breeding. Habitat suitability metrics are used to determine the relative importance of different breeding and non-breeding populations to the overall migratory network. Mignette also allows users to incorporate assignment data from geolocators. The creation of a migratory network is broken into three main parts: Delineating breeding nodes Delineating non-breeding nodes Create migratory network Users with pre-existing data specifying breeding and non-breeding populations, population assignment, and habitat suitability metrics for the populations can use their data directly for the creation of migratory network steps in Mignette. We also provide tools within Mignette to facilitate the delineation of breeding nodes and non-breeding nodes, and provide examples with migratory bird species. 1.1 Installation You can install the development version of Mignette from GitHub with: # install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;mgdesaix/Mignette&quot;) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
