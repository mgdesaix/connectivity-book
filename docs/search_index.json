The core function of mignette is to model the connectivity of populations across different stages of the annual cycle. To model these migratory networks in mignette, users need to provide: The number of individuals connecting migratory populations from two stages of the annual cycle Relative abundance data for the populations We designed mignette specifically for use with population assignment data from genetic markers (Ruegg et al. 2014; DeSaix et al. 2019), and we use genetic markers to delineate breeding populations (i.e., nodes in the migratory network model). We have since extended mignette to be able to model migratory networks that include geolocator data for assignment. While it is outside the scope of mignette for providing an exhaustive tool set of methods to delineate these nodes, given our focus on the use of genetic data, we provide examples and resources for users to delineate breeding populations from genetic data. For nonbreeding populations, we delineate these spatially by ecoregions ADD LINK TO ECOREGION DATA SOURCE. We anticipate users of mignette to be interested in modelling migratory networks for a wide-range of taxa, therefore users can provide relative abundance information from any data source. However, we also provide information on obtaining relative abundance for bird data from eBird and have developed tools in mignette to facilitate the calculation of relative abundance values. For an introductory demonstration of creating a migratory network with mignette, see the quick start example. Subsequent chapters of the vignette provide more detailed instructions and examples for delineating nodes (populations in the network model), calculating relative abundance for nodes, and running and visualizing the network model. 1.1 Installation You can install the development version of mignette from GitHub with: # install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;mgdesaix/mignette&quot;) The migratory network model will be run using R packages that run JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler). JAGS is a specific software for conducting analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. JAGS can be downloaded here The primary packages for this vignette are: library(mignette) library(sf) library(terra) library(tidyverse) library(ebirdst) # for avian abundance data from eBird Status and Trends library(rjags) # for network model library(jagsUI) # for network model library(ggnewscale) # for network visualization library(tidyterra) # for plotting terra objects with ggplot As mignette makes use of the terra package, all raster and vector (e.g., polygons) are provided as SpatRaster and SpatVector objects. See the terra package for more details on these types of objects in R. References "],["quickstart.html", "Chapter 2 Quick start example", " Chapter 2 Quick start example Here, we demonstrate a quick example of how to create a migratory network when the user has all of the data required. To run this tutorial, load the following packages: library(tidyverse) library(mignette) library(rjags) library(jagsUI) library(ggnewscale) The data required are: Relative abundance matrix for each node Assignment matrix of individuals among nodes We provide an example of these data in mignette, with assignment data from 3 populations from the breeding range (WB = Western Boreal, NT = Northern Temperate, ST = Southern Temperate) and nonbreeding range (ALM = Atlantic Lowland Mexico, CAR = Caribbean, AONU = Amazon/Orinoco-Northern Uplands) of the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). The assignment matrix specifies the number of individuals that have been sampled or detected that migrate between different populations (i.e. connect the nodes). mignette::amre_assign Breeding CAR AONU ALM NT 54 0 3 ST 12 12 0 WB 1 0 20 Assignment data input into mignette needs to follow the above format, where the first column specifies breeding population IDs while subsequent columns are the nonbreeding populations. We also provide the relative abundance of these populations: mignette::amre_abundance Population Relative_abundance ST 9874.3106 NT 75628.5485 WB 27340.7038 AONU 942.6022 ALM 1667.3713 CAR 4850.6727 The relative abundance data needs to follow the above format for input into mignette functions with population IDs (same names as in the assignment file) in the first column and relative abundance values in the second column. Column names can follow any naming convention when inputting these data into mignette. For the following functions, we specify the order of the populations we are using for the model. Here, we are just ordering populations geographically by longitude to facilitate straightforward interpretation of the output. bnode_names &lt;- c(&quot;WB&quot;, &quot;NT&quot;, &quot;ST&quot;) wnode_names &lt;- c(&quot;ALM&quot;, &quot;CAR&quot;, &quot;AONU&quot;) The following code provides the necessary data to run the JAGS model. To create the migratory network, the user first creates a text file specifying the JAGS model to be used, providing the name of the file to be saved (base_filename) and the type of model type (model_type). Currently mignette supports two model types based on the type of data used to determine assignment of individuals: 1 indicates that only genetic data were used for assignment, and 2 indicates that there’s assignment data from both genetic and geolocator data. Here, the example only uses genetic data. get_jags_model() saves a .txt file with the base_filename and stores that name as a variable for use in JAGS. We also specify the desired order of the breeding populations (bnode_names) and the nonbreeding populations (wnode_names). Finally, we use these as input into the function get_jags_data() to prepare the data appropriately for the model. base_filename &lt;- mignette::get_jags_model(base_filename = &quot;amre.genetic.model&quot;, model_type = 1) jags_data &lt;- mignette::get_jags_data(abundance = mignette::amre_abundance, assignment = mignette::amre_assign, bnode_names = bnode_names, wnode_names = wnode_names) Now the user can use the output of jags_data into JAGS to run the actual model: parameters &lt;- c(&quot;conn_g&quot;) ni &lt;- 500000 nt &lt;- 4 nb &lt;- 100000 nc &lt;- 2 jags_out &lt;- autojags(jags_data, inits=NULL, parameters, paste0(base_filename,&quot;.txt&quot;), n.chains = nc, n.thin =nt, iter.increment=ni, max.iter = ni*50+nb, n.burnin = nb, n.adapt= NULL, parallel=TRUE) amre_conn &lt;- jags_out$mean$conn_g The connectivity between the nodes is provided by the conn_g parameter of the model, which is accessed from the above code. We provide this output for the example as well with mignette::amre_conn. We also provide functions for basic visualization of the network. A threshold can be set to remove very weak connectivity for better visualizing the network as shown below. # set threshold for not visualizing minimal connectivity amre_conn_test &lt;- mignette::amre_conn amre_conn_test[amre_conn_test &lt; 0.01] &lt;- 0 net &lt;- mignette::net_create(amre_conn_test, node.names = list(bnode_names, wnode_names)) #set the display size range for nodes (min and max), default 1-10 net$display_par$node_size_scale&lt;-c(5,20) #set the display size range for edges (min and max), default 1-10 net$display_par$edge_size_scale&lt;-c(1,5) plot(mignette::net_draw(net)) In this visualization, node size corresponds to the amount of connectivity with that population and edge size corresponds to the amount of connectivity between the populations. By default, breeding populations are in the top row (red) and nonbreeding/wintering populations are in the bottom row (blue). This sums up the basics of creating and visualizing a migratory network. We encourage users to explore and build upon the visualization tools we provide (e.g. overlay the migratory networks on geographic ranges) - the options are endless, enjoy! "],["breeding.html", "Chapter 3 Breeding nodes 3.1 ebirdst 3.2 Creating the genoscape", " Chapter 3 Breeding nodes Delineating breeding nodes is necessary for our migratory network model for both 1) assignment among populations, and 2) specifying a region for relative abundance. Here, we show how breeding nodes can be delineated by genetically distinct populations on the breeding grounds. In this example, we’ll show how to use eBird Status and Trends data to specify the breeding range and then use genetic data from admixture analyses to specify the spatial extent of the breeding nodes. 3.1 ebirdst In our migratory network analyses, the eBird Status and Trends data is used to delineate the different stages of the annual cycle. Prior to doing anything with eBird Status and Trends data, you will need to download the ebirdst package, and then get access to the data. You will need to follow the most up-to-date instructions from the ebirdst developers for getting the abundance data. Currently, that information is here: https://ebird.github.io/ebirdst/ To download the package: # install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;CornellLabofOrnithology/ebirdst&quot;) Then, get access to ebirdst data at https://ebird.org/st/request. You will receive a key to download ebirdst data and you can enter that key in R: ebirdst::set_ebirdst_access_key(&quot;XXXXX&quot;) where \"XXXXX\" is the key. By following instructions from the ebirdst developers, you can obtain polygons of the breeding and nonbreeding ranges of avian species (see https://ebird.github.io/ebirdst/ for details). 3.2 Creating the genoscape A genoscape is the collection of genetically distinct populations that make up a species’ range (Ruegg et al. 2021). Typically, for migratory species, the genoscape describes this population structure on the breeding range because the nonbreeding populations can can contain individuals from different breeding populations. We will outline the main genoscape creation steps here, but full instructions on creating a genoscape map can be found in Eric Anderson’s Github project Make a Bird Genoscape Project map. The input data needed for a genoscape are: Individual Q-value matrix Lat/lon matrix of individuals Breeding range polygon The Q-value matrix is obtained from individual admixture analyses (e.g. Structure, Admixture, snmf fuction from the LEA R-package). Latitude/longitude coordinates are for the individual samples used in the Q-value matrix. Breeding range polygons can be obtained from ebirdst (see previous section). The amre_breeding_data data set provides admixture results (Q-values) for five genetic clusters for American Redstart (DeSaix et al. 2023) and metadata for the sampled individuals.

You can continue on to the relative abundance chapter if you are ready to do that with the genoscape. Or if you still need to create the wintering nodes, check out the next chapter on wintering nodes. The following section is not necessary for the migratory network but details how to covert genoscape rasters to polygons if the mignette user is interested in doing so. 3.2.1 Genoscape polygons Using the genoscape rasters we will convert them to polygons, using the handy scape_to_shape() function. The prob_threshold parameter specifies the value to determine if a raster cell is included in the polygon for that genoscape. This value should be customized for different species to check for overlap of genoscape polygons, which is not desirable. Setting too high of a threshold will create very small breeding nodes, while too low of a threshold will result in large, overlapping breeding nodes. Check out the polygons genoscape_polygons &lt;- mignette::scape_to_shape(x = amre_genoscape, prob_threshold = 0.5) ## Spherical geometry (s2) switched off ggplot() + geom_sf(data = genoscape_polygons,alpha = 0.75, aes(fill = Cluster)) + scale_fill_manual(values = cluster_colors) + theme_bw() Note that the lower population membership probabilities occur at the boundaries of different populations, thereby making the polygons discontinuous compared to the entire range Now on to creating the wintering nodes References "],["wintering.html", "Chapter 4 Nonbreeding nodes 4.1 Subsetting ecoregions 4.2 Select sampled regions", " Chapter 4 Nonbreeding nodes For the migratory networks, we will use ecoregions to define the nonbreeding nodes. However, other nonbreeding nodes could be defined by the user instead. If you already have polygons defining your nodes interest, then continue to the relative abundance section. 4.1 Subsetting ecoregions The ecoregion data is derived from [provide link] and defines biogeographic regions in the Western Hemisphere. We provide these as external data stored as a SpatVector. We will intersect the ecoregions with the nonbreeding range of the American Redstart to identify all the ecoregions for this region. library(mignette) library(terra) library(tidyterra) library(tidyverse) ecoregions &lt;- system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, &quot;ecoregions.Rds&quot;, package = &quot;mignette&quot;) %&gt;% terra::vect() amre_nonbreeding_range &lt;- system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, &quot;amre_nonbreeding_range.Rds&quot;, package = &quot;mignette&quot;) %&gt;% terra::vect() amre_nonbreeding_ecoregions &lt;- terra::intersect(amre_nonbreeding_range, ecoregions) ggplot() + tidyterra::geom_spatvector(data = amre_nonbreeding_ecoregions, aes(fill = Region)) + theme_bw() 4.2 Select sampled regions For the purpose of the migratory network, we are only interested in nonbreeding nodes for which we have sampled data. To identify these nodes, we will intersect our sampled nonbreeding individuals locations with the ecoregion data. Additionally, since sampling locations may fall just outside an ecoregion boundary (for example, imprecise coordinates along a coast) we will identify the ecoregions by selecting the nearest ecoregion to a point. winter_coords &lt;- terra::vect(mignette::amre_nonbreeding_data, geom=c(&quot;Lon&quot;, &quot;Lat&quot;), crs = &quot;EPSG:4326&quot;) winter_coords_nearest &lt;- terra::nearest(winter_coords, ecoregions, centroids = FALSE) # Add Region ID from original file for easier interpretation winter_coords_nearest$Region &lt;- ecoregions$Region[winter_coords_nearest$to_id] table(winter_coords_nearest$Region) ## ## Amazon/Orinoco-Northern Uplands Atlantic Lowland Mexico ## 21 22 ## Caribbean Highland Central America ## 69 5 ## Highland/Interior Mexico Lowland Central America ## 1 14 ## Northern Andes ## 3 For the migratory network, we also want sufficient sampling of a node for the model to be able to reach convergence. In the example above, we see “Highland/Interior Mexico” only has 1 sample and the “Northern Andes” only have 3 samples.

The input data for this step are: Abundance data (Raster) Population ranges (Raster or Vector) Typically, the geographic range of a population will be stored as a vector (e.g., polygon), but in the case of a genoscape, the population ranges can be specified by a raster with q-values. For abundance data, we will use the eBird Status and Trends data, but any abundance data in a raster object can be used. 5.1 Get relative abundance for a genoscape (raster) In the case of a genoscape raster with q-values, we will convert the q-values to probabilities of a pixel belonging to that population which is used to weight the abundance values. This is done with a single function get_genoscape_abunds(), and outputs a two-column matrix with the population names and the relative abundance of each population.
